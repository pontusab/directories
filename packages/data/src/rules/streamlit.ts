# Streamlit Development Best Practices

You are an expert in Streamlit and Python development for creating interactive web applications. 
You understand data visualization, user experience, and performance optimization in Streamlit apps.

## Core Principles

- Build user-friendly, interactive data applications
- Optimize for performance and responsiveness
- Follow Streamlit's declarative programming model
- Implement proper state management
- Create clean, maintainable code structure

## General
- Documentation for latest version: @https://docs.streamlit.io/llms-full.txt or @https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference
- When calling \`st.dataframe\`:
	- Use \`column_config\` to make labels look nicer
	- Don't forget \`st.ProgressColumn\` for percentage columns
	- Set \`hide_index=True\` if the index shows no value
	- If many columns, you likely want to use \`use_container_width=True\`
- When making a multipage app:
	- Define \`page = st.navigation(...)\` in the main module (usually \`streamlit_app.py\`)
	- Underlying pages should have dedicated files in the \`app_pages/\` directory
	- You can display the page title using \`page.title\` and \`page.icon\` before calling \`page.run()\`
	- You should store global variables in \`st.session_state\` in the main module so pages can access them
    - Pages should not exceed 500 lines of code. If they do, you should create utility files to split the code.
- When making a chart:
	- If easy, prefer the native charts \`st.line_chart\`, \`st.scatter_chart\`, \`st.bar_chart\`
	- Else, go for Altair or Plotly (mostly Express)
	- Don't forget to give a human readable label for x, y
- Use \`st.divider()\` instead of \`st.markdown("---")\` for visual separation.

## Layout and customization

- Stick to native Streamlit commands as much as possible, unless told otherwise
- You can update a specific Streamlit component style with \`key='foo'\` in CSS with class \`st-key-foo\`
- You can edit \`.streamlit/config.toml\` for native ways to tune the look and feel of your app
- Don't use too many columns in \`st.columns\`. If you do, remember to configure the \`vertical_alignment\` properly
- Remember you can use \`@st.dialog\` to save some real estate on the UI 
- When adding html, prefer st.html over st.markdown
- You can add \`st.markdown("")\` before new headers to add more vertical space

## Code style and quality guidelines

- Use type hints consistently
- Write docstrings for functions
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use meaningful variable names
- Comment complex logic
- Implement proper error handling

## Common pitfalls to avoid

- Don't put expensive operations outside caching
- Avoid deep nesting columns and expanders
- Don't ignore state management
- Avoid hardcoding values

Remember: Streamlit apps should be fast, intuitive, and maintainable. 
Always think about the user experience and performance implications of your code choices.
