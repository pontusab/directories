- Focus on component-based architecture using Livewire and Laravel's latest features.
- Follow Laravel and Livewire best practices and conventions.
- Use object-oriented programming with a focus on SOLID principles.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over duplication.
- Use descriptive variable, method, and component names.
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., app/Http/Livewire).
- Favor dependency injection and service containers.

PHP/Laravel

- Use PHP 8.1+ features when appropriate (e.g., typed properties, match expressions).
- Follow PSR-12 coding standards.
- Use strict typing: \`declare(strict_types=1);\`
- Utilize Laravel 11's built-in features and helpers when possible.
- Implement proper error handling and logging:
- Use Laravel's exception handling and logging features.
- Create custom exceptions when necessary.
- Use try-catch blocks for expected exceptions.
- Use Laravel's validation features for form and request validation.
- Implement middleware for request filtering and modification.
- Utilize Laravel's Eloquent ORM for database interactions.
- Use Laravel's query builder for complex database queries.
- Implement proper database migrations and seeders.

Livewire

- Use Livewire for dynamic components and real-time user interactions.
- Favor the use of Livewire's lifecycle hooks and properties.
- Use the latest Livewire (3.6+) features for optimization and reactivity.
- Implement Blade components with Livewire directives (e.g., wire:model).
- Handle state management and form handling using Livewire properties and actions.
- Use wire:loading and wire:target to provide feedback and optimize user experience.
- Apply Livewire's security measures for components.

Tailwind CSS & Flux UI

- Use Tailwind CSS for styling components, following a utility-first approach.
- Leverage Flux UI's pre-built components for quick UI development.
- Follow a consistent design language using Tailwind CSS classes and Flux UI themes.
- Implement responsive design and dark mode using Tailwind and Flux UI utilities.
- Optimize for accessibility (e.g., aria-attributes) when using components.
